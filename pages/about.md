## Who am I?

Name is **{{ site.author.name }}**. I will probably write something about myself here later.

## What can I do?

This could be a place to list some of my skills and experience. But not until I figure out the best way to do it.

## What have I been involved in?

The timeline below provides a concise overview of my recent life, mostly regarding education and work. My academic profile is available in [ETIS](https://www.etis.ee/CV/lillemets/eng).

## How did this site come to be?

So about this site. Since it's a static website it took some effort to set up. I may add this story along with some tools I used to create and manage this site. Below is a glimpse of it for now.

Witten in [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) markup language.  
Built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) static site generator.  
Based on the wonderful [portfolYOU](https://github.com/YoussefRaafatNasry/portfolYOU) theme.  
Hosted on [Github](https://github.com/lillemets/lillemets.github.io).
