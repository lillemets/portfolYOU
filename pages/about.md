## How did this site come to be?


So about this site. It's mostly a portfolio but also a blog where I post anything I find worth sharing. Some of the posts contain methods that I sometimes need a quick access to ([e.g. when installing a new system](/setting_up_systemd-boot_for_arch_linux)). 

This is a static site. All content is written in [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) markup language in plain text. Resulting markdown files are then fused together by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) with formatting and theming as specified by [portfolYOU](https://github.com/YoussefRaafatNasry/portfolYOU) template. Well, to some extent, because I've customized the template [to my own taste](https://github.com/lillemets/lillemets.github.io). The site files are pushed to [GitHub](https://github.com/) which also takes care of building and hosting this site.

Before the current design, there was [also a first version](https://www.lillemets.ee/oldsite/).
