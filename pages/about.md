## Who am I?

Name is JÃ¼ri, pronounced as *Jyri*. I'm not sure what to tell here, so below are some random facts.

- I own a dozen photo cameras, along with a couple of dozen lenses. 
- I type using [Colemak](https://colemak.com/) layout on a 61-key keyboard with blank keycaps.
- I spent years studying political science but dislike discussing politics.
- I sort all my waste into 7 different bins.
- I use [Arch](https://www.archlinux.org/) btw. 

## Which tools I use?

For an overview of my skills and experience, some research methods that I've implemented are listed below. As I mostly use R, some of the methods are appended with corresponding R packages and functions that I'm familiar with.

## How did this site come to be?


So about this site. It's mostly a portfolio but also a blog where I post anything I find worth sharing. Some of the posts contain methods that I sometimes need a quick access to ([e.g. when installing a new system](/setting_up_systemd-boot_for_arch_linux)). 

This is a static site. All content is written in [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) markup language in plain text. Resulting markdown files are then fused together by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) with formatting and theming as specified by [portfolYOU](https://github.com/YoussefRaafatNasry/portfolYOU) template. Well, to some extent, because I've customized the template [to my own taste](https://github.com/lillemets/lillemets.github.io). The site files are pushed to [GitHub](https://github.com/) which also takes care of building and hosting this site.
